This app models a Vending Machine in Ruby following good OOP design and SOLID principles. It allows a user to add a set of products and available coins to the machine and then perform transactions against it.

Run the app by running `ruby app.rb` and follow instructions on screen.

Potential improvements

Take money in coin stock
